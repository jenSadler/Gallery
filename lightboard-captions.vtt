Hi! Did you know that Western has a Light Board?

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:05.303
What's a light board?

00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:09.162
Well, it's like magic.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.057
The light board allows you to write in thin air.

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:16.487
You'll never have to turn your back to your students.

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:18.407
How does it work?

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.697
Well, the presenter stands in front of the light board

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:24.599
which is a panel of lighted glass.

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.355
It's filmed by a camera

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.767
and the image is flipped so you can read the words.

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:34.688
