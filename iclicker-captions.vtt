Choose your course discipline

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.390
The course name should make it easy
for your students to find your course

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.260
if they are not using the OWL integration

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.840
For example.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.200

If you are outside of the two

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.959
dates, your course will either not be started,
or will be archived.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.209
For course ID, we suggest that you use the
course name as it appears on OWL

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.319
for example:

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.140
CHEM 1000A 001 FW18
This will guarantee that the name is unique.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.879
To provide extra help for students,
enter the days and times

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:13.099
when the course will take place

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.099
Choose Create

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.299
